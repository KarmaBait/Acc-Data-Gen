How to use the generator:
1. Move all the files in a single directory
2. Click the searchbar within that directory and type "cmd"
3. Make sure you've Python installed, otherwise it's not going to work
4. Once "cmd" opens, type: 'python generator.py' (might sometimes not work with 'python' try 'py' instead)
5. Enjor your new generated password, mail & token!
